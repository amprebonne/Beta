# Overview
This repository contains the project files for a capstone project for MTR-362 Robotics, undertaken as part of an undergraduate mechatronics engineering program.
Our project aims to design, build, and demonstrate an intelligent pick-and-place robotic arm. The system integrates machine vision with real-time control to locate, identify, pick, and place selected objects efficiently overcoming the limitations of simple proximity sensor-based robotic arms.

# Objectives:
- Develop a cost-effective robotic arm with a modular design.
- Implement machine vision for precise object detection and localization.
- Achieve real-time multi-axis control using an STM32 microcontroller and G-code interface.
- Demonstrate pick-and-place tasks in a controlled environment.

# Key features
- Custom robotic arm with a gripper end effector.
- An embedded control system featuring an STM32 with Cortex M0 core
- A camera module and a host PC for machine vision and object detection providing the MCU with multi-axis motion control through real-time G-code interface.
