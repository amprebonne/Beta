# Robo
This repository contains the project files for a Group Capstone Project for MTR 362 - Robotics, undertaken as part of an undergraduate Mechatronics Engineering program.
Our project aims to design, build, and demonstrate an intelligent pick-and-place robotic arm. The system integrates machine vision with real-time control to locate, identify, pick, and place selected objects efficiently â€” overcoming the limitations of simple proximity sensor-based robotic arms.

# Key features include:
- Custom robotic arm modeled in a parametric MCAD software.
- An embedded control system featuring an STM32 microcontroller and an ESP32 camera module;
incorporating an edge-ml model for machine vision and object detection running on the ESP32-CAM setup and multi-axis motion control with real-time G-code command handling on the STM32.

The goal is to showcase an affordable, modular, and intelligent robotic arm that demonstrates practical robotics, embedded systems, and vision-based automation skills at an undergraduate level.
